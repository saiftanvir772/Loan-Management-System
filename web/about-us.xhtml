                                    <small>At Norton we make arranging a loan or mortgage easy, even if you?re retired, self-employed or if you have bad credit history. Because we?re a broker and not a bank, we?re not limited to our own products. Which means more choice and fewer rejections. So if you?ve been refused credit in the past, we want to help.</small>

                                    <small>Just like a comparison site we search all of the top lenders to find the best possible secured loan or mortgage, tailored to your needs. But unlike them we?ll also help you manage your application from start to finish. So whether you need help managing your finances with a debt consolidation loan, a home improvement loan or with any big purchase, Norton are here for you. Piece of cake.</small>
